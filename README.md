# ArithmeticAndTextTool

This is a bash shell script containing several functions that perform mathematical operations and string manipulation. The script starts by defining four functions. The first function, means(), calculates the arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, root mean square, and contraharmonic means of five user-provided integers. The second function, gcd(), calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two user-provided integers using Euclid's algorithm. The third function, lcm(), calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two user-provided integers using the GCD. The fourth function, replace_string(), prompts the user for a text string and two words, and replaces all occurrences of the second word with the first word in the text. The fifth function, days_since_start(), has 3 variables as its input, the first one representing a day, the second a month and the third a year. It returns the number of days that have passed since January 1st of the current year and the number of days remaining until the end of the year.
The script then enters an infinite loop that displays a menu of options for the user to choose from. The user can select from the following options: 1) Compute arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, root mean square, and contraharmonic means of five integers, 2) Compute the GCD of two integers, 3) Compute the LCM of two integers, 4) Replace a word with another word in a text, 5) Calculate the number of days passed and remaining until the end of a year given a day, month, and year, or 6) Exit the program. The user inputs the option number and the script calls the corresponding function to perform the desired operation. After the operation is completed, the user is returned to the menu to select another operation or exit the program.
